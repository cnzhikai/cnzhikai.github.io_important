## Common clutters in writing

### 1 Dead weight words and phrases

Like ***as it is well known, as it has been shown, it can be regarded that, it should be emphasized that…***

One sentence change example:

[Original] As it is well known, increased athletic activity has been related to a profile of lower cardiovascular risk, lower blood pressure levels, and improved muscular and cardio-respiratory performance. 

[Changed] Increased athletic activity lowers cardiovascular risk and blood pressure, and improves fitness.

### 2 Empty words and phrases

Like ***basic tenets of, methodologic, important…***

One sentence change example:

[Original]This paper provides a review of the basic tenets of cancer biology study design, using as examples studies that illustrate the methodologic challenges or that demonstrate successful solutions to the difficulties inherent in biological research.

[Changed] This paper reviews cancer biology study design, using examples that illustrate specific challenges and solutions.

### 3 Long words and phrases that could be short

Like a ***majority of (most), a number of (many), are of the same opinion (agree), less frequently occurring (rare), all three of the (the three), give rise to (cause), due to the fact that (because), have an effect on (affect), based on the assumption that (if)…***

One sentence change example: 

[Original] The expected prevalence of mental retardation, based on the assumption that intelligence is normally distributed, is about 2.5%. 

[Changed] The expected prevalence of mental retardation, if intelligence is normally distributed, is 2.5%.

### 4 Unnecessary jargon and acronyms

Unless generally-known, avoid, or at lest not to overuse the jargon and acronyms to make your scientific writing more understandable.

One sentence change example: (note the miR to microRNA)

[Original] Dysregulation of physiologic microRNA (miR) activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including gliomagenesis. Therefore, molecular species that can regulate miR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant mature miRs may play equally relevant roles in cancer.

[Changed] Changes in microRNA expression play a role in cancer, including glioma. Therefore, events that disrupt microRNAs from binding to their target RNAs may also promote cancer.

### 5 Repetitive words or phrases

Like ***studies/examples, illustrate/demonstrate, challenges/difficulties, successful solutions…***

Like studies/examples, illustrate/demonstrate, challenges/difficulties, successful solutions…

One sentence change example: (note the repetition of responses)

[Original] A robust cell-mediated immune response is necessary, and deficiency in this response predisposes an individual towards active TB. 

[Changed] Deficiency in T-cell-mediated immune response predisposes an individual to active TB.

## More tricks to cut the clutters

### 1 Eliminate negatives. 

Whenever you encounter a negative in your writing, see if you can turn it to positive. The positive makes the structure clear and easier to read.

One sentence change example: (note the repetition of responses)

[Original] They did not believe the drug was harmful.

[Changed] They believed the drug was safe.

### 2 Eliminate “Boring There Be”

After replacing “There be”, you will have an exciting verb! This makes your writing various and fluent to read.

One sentence change example: 

[Original] There was a long line of bacteria on the plate. 

[Changed] Bacteria lined the plate.

# Use the active voice

> *Use active voice when suitable, particularly when necessary for correct syntax (e.g., "To address this possibility, we constructed a λZap library . . .," not "To address this possibility, a λZap library was constructed . . .").  *
> 
> By Some Notes on Science Style, Science Magazine

## Advantages to use active voice

1.  Emphasizes author responsibility – Places more emphasis of author’s role on decisions.

2. Increase readability – It best suits people’s understanding method.

3. Reduce ambiguity – Indicates the subject clearly.

## Tips of active voice's using

1. It is also OK to use passive voice, but use it sparingly and purposefully.

2. In condition that the role of author is unnecessary or unimportant, use the passive voice instead of active voice, for example, the method section of a paper. However, in introduction, result and discussion section of a paper active voice is strongly recommended.

3. Some lecturer may give advice to you not using “We” or “I” in your scientific writhing, however, it is not a good advice. With so many benefits, as well as advice from some famous magazines or journals (Science Magazine for example), active voice is OK in your scientific writhing.

## Practice: use the active voice

One sentence change example: 

[Original] Therefore, the hypothesis that the overall kinetics of a double transtibial amputee athlete and an able-bodied sprinter at the same level of performance are not different was rejected.

[Changed] Therefore, we rejected the hypothesis that the overall kinetics of a double transtibial amputee athlete and an able-bodied sprinter at the same level of performance are comparable.

One sentence change example: 

[Original] The first visible-light snapshot of a planet circling another star has been taken by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. 

[Changed] NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has taken the first visible-light snapshot of a planet circling another star.


# Write with verbs

## Use strong verbs

Verbs make sentence go, they drive readers continue to read, and make writing lively. An appropriate pick of verb makes your writing better. But how? Here are two advice, avoid adverbs and “there be”. When you are trying to ***avoid adverbs and “there be structure”***, you are actually proceeding to write with strong verbs.

One sentence change example: (note that reports approximately can be replaced by estimates, and second estimates can be replaced by a better verb, project.)

[Original] The WHO reports that approximately two-thirds of the world’s diabetics are found in developing countries, and estimates that the number of diabetics in these countries will double in the next 25 year.

[Changed] The WHO estimates that two-thirds of the world’s diabetics are found in developing countries, and projects that the number of diabetics in these countries will double in the next 25 years.


## Don't turn verbs into nuns, or let weak verbs replace strong verbs

First, when you have a choice to decide whether using a noun or a verb with similar meaning, don’t hesitate to choose verb. Verb makes your writing smoother to read, and leave reads deeper impression. Second, don’t let boring verb boring nouns replace the strong verb. For example, use the latter one instead of the former one in the following parts, ***obtain estimates of/estimate, has seen an expansion in/has expanded, provides a methodologic emphasis/emphasizes methodology, take an assessment of/assess, provide a review of/review, offer confirmation of/confirm, make a decision/decide, show a peak/peaks, provide a description of/describe.***

One sentence change example: (do not let nouns replace verbs)

[Original] During DNA damage, recognition of H3K4me3 by ING2 results in recruitment of Sin3/HDAC and repression of cell proliferation genes.

[Changed] During DNA damage, H3K4me3 recruits ING2 and Sin3/HDAC, which together repress cell proliferation genes.

One sentence change example: (do not let nouns replace verbs)

[Original] During DNA damage, recognition of H3K4me3 by ING2 results in recruitment of Sin3/HDAC and repression of cell proliferation genes.

[Changed] During DNA damage, H3K4me3 recruits ING2 and Sin3/HDAC, which together repress cell proliferation genes.

## Don't bury the main verb

Keep the subject and the main verb (predicate) close together at the start of the sentence, because only seeing the predicate can readers know where the sentence is going and understand the meaning you are expressing.

One sentence change example:

[Original] The fear expressed by some teachers that students would not learn statistics well if they were permitted to use canned computer programs has not been realized in our experience. and after the introduction of computers in the teaching of our course revealed no appreciable change in students’ performances.

[Changed] Many teachers feared that the use of canned computer programs would prevent students from learning statistics. We monitored student achievement levels before and after the introduction of computers in our course and found no detriments in performance.
