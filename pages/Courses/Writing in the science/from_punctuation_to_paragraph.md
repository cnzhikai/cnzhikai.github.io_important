## 1 Use punctuation to vary sentence structure

### 1.1 Use of semicolon

#### 1.1.1 The semicolon connects two independent clauses

A clause is a unit of grammatical organization just below a sentence in rank; it always contains a subject and predicate. ***The semicolon makes two clauses stand out from each other, but do not lose potential connection.***

One sentence change example:

[Example]Kennedy could be a cold and vain man, and he led a life of privilege. But he knew something about the world; he also cared about it. 

[Comment] The semicolon in the sentence serves best to make us understand instead of knowing the world, Kennedy also cared about it. And makes us fell that the two clauses are connected. If we change the semicolon to the comma, we cannot find emphasis on caring; if we change the semicolon to period, the two parts are so separated.

One sentence example:
[Example]It was the best of times; it was the worst of times.


#### 1.1.2 Separate items in lists that contain internal punctuation

***If you have used comma to do the separation, you can not use it again in your sentence structure to do the separation, then use semicolon!***

One sentence example:

[Example] They dramatically reduced the number of series in production: in 1935, fourteen series were circulating; in 1940, nine; by 1980, when the syndicate was in its final years, only four.

[Comment] In the sentence, because we have also used comma, then we can only use semicolon to do the separation.

### 1.2 Use of parentheses

Use parentheses to insert an afterthought or explanation (a word, phrase, or sentence) into a passage that is grammatically complete without it. In fact, when you put something in parentheses, you mean readers can ignore them, but do not lose main points. ***However, the insertion in the parentheses much add the rich to your writhing.***

One sentence example:

[Example] This is troubling because, while there are plausible biological stories to connect red meat with cancer and heart disease, it seems unlikely that eating too much red meat could directly cause accidents and injuries. (Unless, as one of my students quipped, red meat eaters are swerving to avoid cows!) 

[Comment] The sentence in parentheses is writer’s intention to entertain the readers.

### 1.3 Use of colon

Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list, quote, explanation, conclusion, or amplification. ***The colon has more effect than the comma, less power to separate than the semicolon, and more formality than the dash.***

One sentence example: (colon to introduce an explanation)

[Example] The hydrogen bonds are made as follows: purine position 1 to pyrimidine position 1; purine position 6 to pyrimidine position 6. (A structure for DeoxyriboseNucleic Acid—Watson and Crick 1953)

One sentence example: (colon to introduce a solution)

[Example] Washington has a simple solution to most governments it doesn’t like: isolate them, slap sanctions on them, and wait for their downfall.

One sentence example: (colon to introduce a list; notice the author lists three items, that is common when we listing, the rule is called the rule of three’s)

[Example] They gradually reduced the number of employees: in 1980, the company had 300 employees; in 1995, 150; by 2005, when the company was in its final years, only 11.

One sentence example: (colon to introduce an amplification; note the “T” is capitalized behind the colon, it is to notice the readers that the second clause is a full sentence. To use colon like this, the clause should base on the first one.)

[Example] Companies use Marsh for the same reason that home sellers use real-estate agents: The agent’s knowledge and experience is supposed to help the client get the right deal at the right price.

### 1.4 Use of dash

A dash is a mark of separation stronger than a comma, less formal than a colon, and more relaxed than parentheses. Use dash to add emphasis or to insert an abrupt definition or description almost anywhere in the sentence. Just don’t overuse it, or it loses its impact: Use a dash only when a more common mark of punctuation seems inadequate. 

One sentence example: (dash to emphasis and add information; if you use other punctuations like commas and parentheses, the sentences goes clunky and long …)

[Example]Researchers who study shipworms say these mislabeled animal – they’re clams, not worms – are actually a scientific treasure.

### 1.5 Summary of punctuations

The proper use of punctuations can make your writing with more varieties, and express clearer and more efficient. However, consider the power of separating and formality before you want to use a punctuation, do not let your writing clunky.

Increasing power to separate (from left to right):

Comma, colon, dash, parentheses, semicolon, period.

Increasing formality (from left to right):

Dash, parentheses, the others (comma, colon, semicolon, period).


## 2 Parallelism

Pairs of ideas, lists of ideas, or other structures joined by “and”, “or”, or “but” should be written in parallel form, which means they should have similar structure. Also, don’t forget the “the rule of three’s” we mentioned before.

One example:

[Unparallel] Locusts denuded fields in Utah, rural Iowa was washed away by torrents, and in Arizona the cotton was shriveled by the placing heat.

[Parallel] Locusts denuded fields in Utah, torrents washed away rural Iowa, and blazing heat shriveled Arizona’s cotton.

One example:

[Unparallel] If you want to be a good doctor, you must study hard, critically think about the medical literature, and you should be a good listener. 

[Parallel] If you want to be a good doctor you must study hard, listen well, and think critically about the medical literature. (imperative, imperative, imperative)

[Parallel] If you want to be a good doctor, you must be a good student, a good listener, and a critical thinker about the medical literature. (noun, noun, noun)

## 3 Build up paragraphs

### 3.1 Overview tips when building a paragraph

1. One paragraph one idea, and short paragraphs. Too many ideas in one paragraph makes your writing less focused, and long paragraph makes readers feel tedious and hard to get through. Therefore, use the paragraph to delineate to your reader when you’re switching to a new idea, and makes your paragraph shorter.

2. Give away the punch line early, and emphasis at the end. Start with the most important point, the take-home massage, and then you filter down from there with the supporting ideas. Your reader remembers the first sentence and the last sentence best, so make the last sentence memorable.

3. Mind the paragraph flow: logical flow of ideas, parallel sentence structures, and transition words if necessary. 

### 3.2 Logical flow of ideas

1. Sequential in time (avoid the Memento approach). The sequential in time makes your sentences to flow naturally from one to the next.

2. From general to specific.

3. Logical arguments. Outline the logical arguments that you want to make in your prose, which insures the sound logic that’s easy for readers to follow.

One example:

[Original] Usually, when a defendant absconds, a bondsman hires a bounty hunter to find and arrest him within the grace period (which, in California, is six months). If that fails, the bondman tries to seize any collateral that the defendant put down to secure the bond, or sues the defendant’s “indemnitors,” who signed the bail application as guarantors. But Zabala hadn’t put down any collateral, and so far Green—one of the few bondsmen who always do their own bounty hunting—had found neither him nor his indemnitors. The grace period was nearly up. Soon, Green would have to pay the court thirty-one thousand dollars. 

[Analyse: organized by: time sequence and general to specific] 

1. First, a bondsman hires a bounty hunter to find and arrest the defendant within the grace period.
2. Then, if that fails, the bondman seizes collateral or sues indemnitors.
3. Now, in this specific case, the defendant (Zabala) is AWOL and has no collateral or available indemnitors
4. Conclusion: the bondswoman (Green) is out of options.

[Analyse: the logical structure]

A bondsman has these and only these options:

1. Hire a bounty hunter to find and arrest the guy within a grace period.
2. If (1) fails, seize collateral or sue indemnitor.
3. Pay the money herself.
In this case,
1. Grace period nearly done without arrest.
2. No collaterol, no indemnitors.
3. 
∴ Green (the bondswoman) will be responsible for the $31,000.

[Analyse: Emphasis at the end]
*But Zabala hadn’t put down any collateral, and so far Green—one of the few bondsmen who always do their own bounty hunting—had found neither him nor his indemnitors. The grace period was nearly up. Soon, Green would have to pay the court thirty-one thousand dollars.*
Long, short, long. Nice sentence variety and build-up to the conclusion.

### 3.3 Few more tips

#### 3.3.1 It is OK to repeat a word

It is OK to repeat a word, but first consider the following before you decide to do this. If you have positive answer, the repetition is OK.

When you find yourself reaching for the thesaurus to avoid using a word twice within the same sentence or even paragraph, ask:

(1)Is the second instance of the word even necessary?

(2)If the word is needed, is a synonym really better than just repeating the word?

#### 3.3.2 Avoid needless synonyms

To avoid repetition, writers have needlessly (and amusingly) come up with the following synonyms, that's bad!

Banana/“the elongated yellow fruit”; Beaver/“the furry, paddle-tailed mammal”; Mustache/“under-nose hair crops”; Milk from a cow/“the vitamin-laden liquid”from a “bovine milk factory”; Skis/“the beatified barrel staves”

#### 3.3.3 Avoid disastrous synonyms

Whereas it’s just amusing or inelegant in some types of writing, in scientific writing it’s a disaster. The reader may think you are referring to a different instrument, model, group, variable, etc.

It’s OK to repeat words. Resist the temptation to abbreviate words simply because they recur frequently! (recall: miR instead of microRNA)

Use only standard acryonyms/initialisms (e.g., RNA). Don’t make them up!

If you must use acronyms, define them separately in the abstract, each table/figure, and the text. For long papers, redefine occasionally (as readers don’t typically read start to finish).
