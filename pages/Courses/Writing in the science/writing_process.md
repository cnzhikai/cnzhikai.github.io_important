Usually, you take three steps to do the scientific writing: pre-writing step, writing the first draft step, and revision step. To be a good writer, you have to fully prepare before you begin writing, knowing what you are going to cover. Then, finish your first draft first quickly. Finally, do the revision. 

The writing procedure:

1.	Pre-writing: Collect, synthesize, and organize information; brainstorm take-home messages; work out ideas away from the computer; develop a roadmap/outline.
2.	Writing the first draft: Putting your facts and ideas together in organized prose.
3.	Revision: Read your work out load; get rid of clutter; do a verb check; get feedback from others. 


## 1 Pre-writing step tips

### 1.1 Get organized first with your organizational system

Don’t try to write and gather information simultaneously! Gather and organize information BEFORE writing the first draft.

If you don’t have your organization system, build one now. A choice for you: create a Word documentation, put all you get (related literature, comments, views, etc.) into it with clear contents so that you can hastily obtain what you want when you are writing.

### 1.2 Brainstorm away from the computer

Write on the go! While exercising (Turn off that ipod!), driving alone (Turn off the radio!), waiting in line (Put down the magazine!), you can think for new ideas for your draft. Make memorable lines if possible.

### 1.3 Develop a road map

Arrange key facts and citations from the literature into a crude road map/outline BEFORE writing the first draft. Think in paragraphs and sections. 

Begin compositional organization by grouping like ideas and paragraphs.

## 2 The writing step tips

1. Don’t be a perfectionist!
2. The goal of the first draft is to get the ideas down in complete sentences in order.
3. Focus on logical organization more than sentence-level details.
4. Writing the first draft is the hardest step for most people. Minimize the pain by writing the first draft quickly and efficiently!

One example:

[First draft] Errors in publication occur when the authors have typos, omissions, or such poor writing of the methods that others cannot figure out what they did or reproduce their tables and figures. Sometimes there’s just so much to write up that errors will occur in almost every case.

[Revised] Published papers frequently have typos, omissions, and otherwise poor documentation of methods. These errors make it impossible to figure out exactly what was done or to reproduce the results.

## 3 Revision step tips

### 3.1 Read your work out loud

The brain processes the spoken word differently than the written word!

### 3.2 Do a verb check

Watch for:

1. lackluster verbs (e.g., There are many students who struggle with chemistry.)
2. passive verbs (e.g., The reaction was observed by her.)
3. buried verbs (e.g., A careful monitoring of achievement levels before and after the introduction of computers in the teaching of our course revealed no appreciable change in students’ performances.).

### 3.3 Cut clutter

Watch for:

1. Dead weight words and phrases (it should be emphasized that)
2. Empty words and phrases (basic tenets of, important)
3. Long words or phrases that could be short (muscular and cardiorespiratory performance)
4. Unnecessary jargon and acronyms
5. Repetitive words or phrases (teaches clinicians/guides clinicians)
6. Adverbs (very, really, quite, basically)

### 3.4 Do an organizational review

In the margins of your paper, tag each paragraph with a phrase or sentence that sums up the main point.Then move paragraphs around to improve logical flow and bring similar ideas together.

### 3.5 Get feedback from others

Ask someone outside your department to read your manuscript.
Without any technical background, they should easily grasp:

1. the main findings
2. take-home messages
3. significance of your work
4. Ask them to point out particularly hard-to-read sentences and paragraphs!

### 3.6 Get editing help

Find a good editor to edit your work!

## 4 Checklist for final draft

### 4.1 Check for consistency

One example:

“We followed participants for a minimum of 2 years” (methods section)

“The average follow-up time was 1.5 years” (results section)

After a long time of editing, you may change something in the writing but forget to do the responding changes in other places of your passage, one example is shown above. Do the check to avoid such phenomena.


### 4.2 Check for numerical consistency

Ask yourself the following questions,

1. Do the numbers in your abstract match the numbers in your tables/figures/text?
2. Do the numbers in the text match those in the tables/figures?
3. Do the numbers in each table/figure match those in other tables/figures?

### 4.3 Check your references

Make sure,
1.	List all references you use with clear numeration;
2.	Cite back to primary sources to avoid “***citation propagation***”.
