# Principles of Effective Writing

## Tips to Cut the clutters

### Avoid dead weight words and phrases
	
- As it is well known
- As it has been shown
- It can be regarded that
- It should be emphasized that

### Avoid empty words and phases

- basic tenets of 
- methodologic

>>EXAMPLE

>This paper reviews the basic principles of cancer biology study design.
	
>This paper reviews cancer biology study design.

### Don't Use long words or phases that could be short

- are of the same opinion -> agree
- Due to the fact that -> because
- have an effect on -> affect
- based on the assumption that -> if

### Avoid unnecessary jargon and acronyms

- miR -> microRNA
- muscular and cardiorespiratory performance -> fitness

>>EXAMPLE
>	
>Dysregulation of physiologic microRNA (miR) activity has been shown to play an important role in tumor initiation and progression, including gliomagenesis. Therefore, molecular species that can regulate miR activity on their target RNAs without affecting the expression of relevant mature miRs may play equally relevant roles in cancer.
>	
>Changes in microRNA expression play a role in cancer, including glioma. Therefore, events that disrupt microRNAsfrom binding to their target RNAsmay also promote cancer.
>	
>Comment: It is unnecessary to use miR to represent microRNA because it is not a key jargon throughout passages, and it makes readers harder to read.

### Avoid uncessary repetitive words or phrases

>>EXAMPLE
>	
>A robust cell-mediated immune response is necessary, and deficiency in this response predisposes an individual towards active TB.
>	
>Deficiency in T-cell-mediated immune response predisposes an individual to active TB.
>
>Comment: Unnessary repetition will make sentence long and boring, try to avoid repetition.*

### Some adverbs can be released

- very, really, quite, basically, ...

### Eliminate negatives

>>EXAMPLE
>	
>She did not want to perform the experiment incorrectly.
>	
>She wanted to perform the experiment correctly.
>	
>Comment: Eliminating negatives enables readers better understand.

### Eliminate superfluous uses of "there are/there is"

>>EXAMPLE
>	
>There was a long line of bacteria on the plate.
>	
>Bacteria lined the plate.
